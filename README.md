# Greetings 👋

Hey there, I'm Rami Sabbagh, an AI Engineer freshly graduated at 2024.

Started programming at the age of 13 (~11 years ago) with the help of the Internet. Got passionate in computers and technology. Then studied Information Technology Engineering with a specialization in AI at [Damascus University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus_University) to get dried out from pressure and idealism 😆

Currently learning robotics on my own and going to do a MSc in them.

Hope I can get engaged back again in the online communities and contribute to interesting public projects.
